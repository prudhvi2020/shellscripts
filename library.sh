#The Central library needs a way to determine the cost that a student has to pay for renting a Book
#The Fee Structure is shown in the following list:
#The cost is Rs 30 /- Per Day.
#If the Book is returned after 9 PM,the student will be charged an extra day.
#If the Book is rented on a Sunday, the student will get 50% off for as long as they keep the book.
#If the Book is rented on a Saturday, the student will get 30% ff as long as they keep the book.
#We need to write the code to meet this requiement?
